This GitHub repository features a gender recognition model built with TensorFlow and Python,
utilizing transfer learning with the EfficientNetB2 architecture as the base model. 
The dataset consists of 100 images for each gender (male and female), and the model was trained for 10 epochs,
achieving an impressive accuracy of 98%. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts, 
making it easy to replicate and build upon.
